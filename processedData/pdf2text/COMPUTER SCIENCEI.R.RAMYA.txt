enthusiastic hard working have an eye for detail innovative inquisitive in nature motivated persistent ready to learn reliable research oriented self starter skillful team player trustworthy. interests traveling fixing day to day computer issues mostly dealing with viruses managing small networks and fixing few hardware issues. 1. compiled a research paper on ambigraph an ambient intelligence modeling system published in the ieee explore and had been selected for presentation at the international conference for computer engineering and technology iccet 2009 at singapore in jan 09. abstract in computing ambient intelligence ami refers to electronic environments that are sensitive and responsive to the presence of people. in an ambient intelligent world devices work in concert to support people in carrying out their everyday life activities tasks and rituals in easy natural way using information and intelligence that is hidden in the network connecting these devices. the ambient intelligence paradigm builds upon ubiquitous computing and human centric computer interaction design. in this paper we introduce a notation called ambigraphs for specifying the work flow in any ambient intelligence system. an ambigraph is elegant when it is designed to adapt to the wide range of users that work on it. 2. video indexing using matlab vc++ and ms access in aerial image exploitation lab aiel ade drdo bangalore. tools used matlb simulink vc++ ms access oracle 10g. work done edge and line detection using sobel algorithm. shot detection using sobel on matlab and vc++. pattern matching on grayscale and color images and videos on matlab. creating database on ms access and linking it to matlab. obtaining metadata. inserting large objects into ms access and retrieving them on matlab. using gui to obtain video and create key frames. feature extraction color clustering using kmeans algorithm. reference 1 reference 2 co curricular activities extracting color feature descriptors of an image mean standard deviation. extraction of texture descriptors using gabor filter gaussian filter euclidean distance. 3. designed an algorithm emulator as a part of software engineering project. using adobe flex the shortest path algorithms were emulated graphically. prims kruskals and dijkstras algorithms were emulated. 4. participated in the intel science talent discovery fair in 2003 at iiit hyderabad. project title solar powered train abstract of work done modeled a train that works on solar power. the solar panel was mounted on its ceiling. it can also be kept in the solar reservoirs and energy can be extracted and transported to the train. 5. developed and deployed a medical database as a part of database system project. work done linking php to oracle. constructing a database on first aid herbal treatment and common diseases. retrieving this data on a browser. logins were used to accept user feedback. 6. developed a blocking software that can be deployed at the server to block undesired sites as a mini project. it checks the requests sent to the proxy server and filters them based on the blacklist provided in a database. the administrator can configure the blacklist. this way malicious sites can be blocked in organizations using a lan. 7. developing a wireless sensor network simulator that can simulate communication among wireless nodes as final project. ongoing a user can fix a base station and several sensor nodes. the simulator shows how these nodes communicate to the base station in a clustered hierarchy using leach protocol for routing. for security in the network re keying mechanism is used to provide a new set of keys to the authentic nodes. this allows us to detect intruders and eliminate them.
