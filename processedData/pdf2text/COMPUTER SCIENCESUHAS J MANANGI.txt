bangalore may june 2008 project under dr.tim poston professor in nias national institute for advanced studies iisc bangalore during which jooming application was built which is a text navigation software which skims through and dives into text with weighted zooming in and out capability research papers 1.international conference on cryptography coding and information security icccis 2010 march 29 31 2010 rio de janeiro brazil accepted paper titled elliptic curve cryptographic security in transmission control protocol yet to be presented in the conference. this paper proposes adding security features into transmission control protocol by superimposing security features into existing tcp with elliptic curve cryptography.same is accepted in iccnt 2010 bangkok thailand iccet 2010 chengdu sichuan china reference 1 reference 2 co curricular activities 2.ieee international advanced computing conference ieee iacc march 6 7 2009 india published a paper titled integration of tcpip module into bios to boot remote operating system. isbn 978 981 08 2465 5 paper id ieee appl 1228. this paper is about building tcpip protocol stack at bios level thus using it to boot remote operating system same was accepted in wce 2009 london uk icc 2009 fullerton california imecs 2009 hong kong worldcomp 2009 nevada usa current final year projects ongoing 1.elliptic curve cryptographic security in transmission control protocol building security functions into the tcp protocol using elliptic curve cryptography making tcp secured thus making application layer free from security issues and providing process to process security. 2.distributed dos attack tool with ip spoofing capabilities tool to perform distributed denial of service attack with forged ip ip spoofing. this tool helps the researchers and developers to design implement and to test solutions against denial of service attacks. other class room mini projects 1.optimization of recursive descent parser by left factoring and elimination of left recursion optimizing the recursive descent parser top down parser by performing left factoring and then by elimination of left recursion. this was work was carried out in an attempt to reduce the execution time of top down parsers. 2.design and implementation of dd aes symmetric private key block cipher built a data encryptiondecryption tool in which the data dependent rotation property of rc5 was merged with aes which had data independent rotations attempting to make aes more secure. 3.online telephone directory this was a data base project in which a universal telephone directory was created and a user friendly and informative gui to access the data base. 4.solving 9x9 sudoku using constraint satisfaction an artificial intelligence approach developed a program which solves 9x9 sudoku with constraint satisfaction and problem space mechanism of artificial intelligence. 5.application of grid computing concepts in brute force attack on des cipher developed a customized tool to establish and manage grid system which breaks the 56bit key of des cipher using the established computer grid. dr. tim poston professor at nias iisc bangalore karanataka
